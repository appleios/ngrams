Have you absentee 
voted in in 
in Texas 
Oh you mean the special interest groups 
You know Karen I wonder if we are recording 
they hold it on the weekends 
To absentee vote specifically 
Why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public And the public 's uh 
gullibility 
But is n't that is n't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just do n't vote 
did you not press one 
But I mean is not that 
uh is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world
